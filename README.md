# Welcome to Draco

## What's Draco?

Draco is a framework to write applications running on the `Google cloud` platform using the
Google Functions and Compute Engine.

Draco provides high-level, opiniated abstractions to produce code to be shipped on both services,
with a focus on making developement and production deployment quick and easy.

Draco is developped in the same spirit as the Rails framework and consists of a selection of default
tools and APIs along with pre-defined conventions to help speed up the development process.
